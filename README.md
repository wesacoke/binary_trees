# Binary Trees

## Overview

### What are Binary Trees?

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children: left and right. The topmost node is called the root, and the nodes without children are called leaves. Binary trees are widely used in computer science and programming due to their efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
